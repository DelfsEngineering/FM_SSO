FileMaker WebDirect Single Sign On (SSO)
Single Sign On is the user authentication method where a user only enters their credentials once. This is usually when the users either joins the network or when the first application that requires authentication is reached. Single Sign On is not a native feature to Filemaker WebDirect and to allow its support additional code has to be added.

SSO has been achieved with the addition of two PHP support files combined with Filemaker scripting.
